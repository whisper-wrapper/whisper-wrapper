THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES

This file summarizes third-party components with distribution implications for
binary builds (PyInstaller/DEB). It is not legal advice.

Bundled in PyInstaller builds:

- PyQt6 (GPL-3.0-only or commercial). This project is GPL-3.0-or-later; keep
  GPL notices and provide source for GPL distribution. Commercial distribution
  of PyQt6 requires a commercial license from Riverbank.
- PyQt6-Qt6 (LGPL-3.0-only). Redistributing Qt libraries requires compliance
  with LGPL terms (e.g., allow replacement/relinking of the LGPL parts and
  provide the license text).
- faster-whisper (MIT). Include the MIT license text.
- NVIDIA CUDA runtime wheels: nvidia-cublas-cu12, nvidia-cudnn-cu12
  (LicenseRef-NVIDIA-Proprietary). Redistribution may be restricted; review
  NVIDIA's license before shipping GPU-enabled binaries.

System dependencies (not bundled in the DEB; installed via distro packages):

- FFmpeg. Licensing depends on build options; Debian builds are GPL v2+ and
  some variants become GPL v3+ when linked with Apache-2.0 libraries. If you
  bundle FFmpeg, comply with the license of the specific build.
- PortAudio (MIT-style license). Debian's libportaudio2 package is MIT.

This list is focused on high-impact components and is not exhaustive.
